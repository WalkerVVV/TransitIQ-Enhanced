# FirstMile Dashboard Fix Guide
## What We Fixed

We identified that your TransitIQ dashboard was falling back to demo mode because it couldn't map FirstMile column names to what the dashboard expects.

### The Problem
The dashboard expects specific column names like:
- `Days In Transit`
- `Xparcel Type`
- `SLA Status`
- `Calculated Zone`
- etc.

But FirstMile exports might have different names like:
- `Transit Days` or `Delivery Days`
- `Service Level` or `Shipping Method`
- `Delivery Status` or `On Time Status`
- `Zone` or `Shipping Zone`

### The Solution
We created an enhanced column mapper (`firstmile_column_mapper.py`) that:

1. **Maps 50+ common FirstMile column variations** to dashboard expected names
2. **Calculates missing fields**:
   - Days In Transit from Request/Delivery dates
   - SLA Status from service type and transit days
   - Converts weight from pounds to ounces if needed
3. **Integrated it into the dashboard** for automatic column mapping

## How to Test

### 1. Test the Column Mapper
```bash
python test_mapper.py
```
This shows how the mapper transforms FirstMile columns.

### 2. Check Your File's Columns
```bash
streamlit run test_file_upload.py
```
Upload your file to see:
- What columns it has
- Which ones map to dashboard requirements
- Suggested mappings

### 3. Run the Fixed Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Now when you upload your FirstMile file:
- Enable "Debug Mode" in the sidebar to see mapping details
- The dashboard should properly process your data
- No more falling back to demo mode!

## If Issues Persist

If your file still doesn't work:

1. **Check Debug Mode** - It will show which columns are missing
2. **Run the File Tester** - See what columns your file actually has
3. **Update the Mapper** - Add new column variations to `FIRSTMILE_COLUMN_MAPPINGS` in `firstmile_column_mapper.py`

## Common FirstMile Column Mappings

| Your File Might Have | Dashboard Expects |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Transit Days | Days In Transit |
| Service Level | Xparcel Type |
| Ship Date | Request Date |
| Delivered Date | Delivery Date |
| Dest State | Destination State |
| Shipping Cost | Cost |
| Package Weight | Weight |
| Zone | Calculated Zone |

## Next Steps

1. Test with your actual FirstMile file
2. Let me know what columns aren't mapping
3. We can add more mappings as needed

The dashboard is now much more flexible and should handle most FirstMile export variations!
